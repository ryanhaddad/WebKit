Using significant resources and eligible for resource monitoring.
Resource is compressed so network usage is very low.

<script>
    const size = 20 * 1024;
    fetch(`../generate-byte.py?size=${size}&compress=1`).then(async (response) => {
        const body = await response.blob();
        parent.postMessage(body.size, "*");
    });
</script>
