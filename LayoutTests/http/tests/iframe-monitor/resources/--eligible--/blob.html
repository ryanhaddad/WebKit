Using significant resources and eligible for resource monitoring.
Resource is created as Blob and shouldn't treat as network usage.

<script>
    const size = 20 * 1024;
    const body = new Uint8Array(size);
    body.fill(42);

    const blob = new Blob(body, { type: "application/octet-stream" });
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

    fetch(url).then(async (response) => {
        const body = await response.blob();
        parent.postMessage(true, "*");
    });
</script>
