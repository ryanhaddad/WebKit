supportsFullScreen() == true
enterFullScreenForElement()
beganEnterFullScreen() - initialRect.size: {800, 600}, finalRect.size: {300, 150}

FIXME: Size after entering should be 600x800 like it is with site isolation off.
The size currently comes from screenRectOfContents.
Also, there should be exitFullScreenForElement and beganExitFullScreen callbacks like there are with site isolation off.

Size after entering fullscreen: 150x300
Size after exiting fullscreen: 150x300
